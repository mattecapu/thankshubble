# Thanks, Hubble!
#### A website celebrating the 25th anniversary of Hubble Telescope deployment.

The site will display the latest scientific results achieved thanks to Hubble instruments and data gathered in the latest years.

The papers will be searched through Microsoft Academic Search API. While waiting for the API key, it's using arXiv API altough it's much poorer in terms of results.
